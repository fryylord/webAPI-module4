## Solution for Module 4 Challenge

This site has been created as an interactive quiz to test the knowledge of the participant and give a score based on the performance.  A penalty is assesed for incorrect answers, subtracting from the time based score.  After completion, the participant can enter their initials to log their score, as well as view previous scores and their rankings.

## Installation

All you need is the index.html file, allong with the directory assets.  These should be in the parent repository directory, with assets being a child directly within the parent.

## Usage

## Credits

While much of this was assembled on my own, various pieces of source code from https://ku.bootcampcontent.com/ku-coding-boot-camp/KU-VIRT-FSF-PT-09-2022-U-LOLC/ have been used.
